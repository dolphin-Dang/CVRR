This assignment is completed with Matlab.

To execute the codes, make sure that you have correctly entered the right path. (i.e. `/EdgeDetection/prob_seg/` for test edgeDetection and `/ImageSegmentation/` for imageSegmentation.)

+ For task 1 edge detection, my codes are in `/EdgeDetection/prob_seg/solutions/`. You only need to execute file `evaluateSegmentation.m` for any test.
+ For task 2 image segmentation, my codes are `quantizeFeats.m`、`myconv.m`、`createTextons.m`、`extractTextonHists.m`、`compareSegmentations.m`. There is also a `segmentMain.m` file for you to execute, which calls all functions(files) mentioned before and do some auto tests. Configures can be changed easily in it.
